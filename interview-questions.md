# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
  Props is a special keyword in React that is being used for passing data through components to one another. Props can only flow one way, from parent to child. Because it is a one way flow, it is not possible to pass data from child to parent.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
The Virtual DOM are events are also known as user events, meaning that there are functions that are being executed when a user interacts with the browser. Examples: click, keypress, mouseover, mouseout, etc.

Document - file. Object - tags/elements. Model - layout/ structure.


3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
OOP focuses on data or objects rather than functions and logic. An object is something that has unique attributes and behavior. This style of programming is best use for large-scale codebase and software with multiple people and teams on one single project. OOP has four main principles: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOP is different than functional programming, because functional programming focuses on functions and OOP focuses on classes and objects.


4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
The difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby is that a Float is a decimal given value and an Integer is given value to the nearest whole number. An example of a Float can look like (1.0) or (2.4). An example of an Integer can look like any number (-45) negative or positive (100). Any of these can be given to a variable (integer = 1) and printed by calling on the variable (p integer).


5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
Implicit return is a way to return a value without having to call for it. This is useful for functions that are being called in a loop. Some people tend to not use the return keyboard explicity, but instead use the implicit return.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable:
An instance variable in ruby has a name starting with @ symbol, and its content is restricted to whatever the object itself refers to. Two separate objects, even though they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their instance variables.

2. PostgreSQL:
PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database management system. It was developed at the University of California at Berkeley Computer Science Department.

3. Ruby on Rails:
It is a framework for web applications using the Ruby programming language. It works on the back end and can be useful to avoid repetitive, time consuming tasks.

4. ORM:
ORM: Object-relational mapping - A technique used to have object oriented programming languages talk to one another and perform in a single database.

5. Active Record:
Rails Active Records provide an interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby program code that manipulates database records. Ruby method names are automatically generated from the field names of database tables. Active Record is a Rails ORM. Active Record takes data which is stored in a database table and lets you interact with the data like a Ruby object.
